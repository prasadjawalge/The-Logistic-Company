# The-Logistic-Company

This project involved analyzing and processing data from the data engineering pipelines of The Logistic Company, a fast-growing player in the logistics industry in India. The goal was to clean, manipulate and extract useful features from the raw data, in order to build forecasting models that would help the company improve its quality, efficiency, and profitability.

The project involved several steps, including basic data exploration, treating null or missing values, detecting outliers using IQR method, performing univariate and bivariate analysis, and handling categorical variables using one-hot encoding method. Additionally, analysis after feature creation was performed, hypothesis testing was conducted, and numerical features were normalized using either minmax scaler or standard scaler.

The project was designed to help the Data team build intelligence and capabilities that would enable them to widen the gap between The Logistic Company and its competitors, by leveraging world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.
